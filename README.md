# Lab_PathFinding
A Unity simulation to learn more about path finding algorithms.

Inspired by this [incredible visualisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgW0HPHqFE8) and the great video series by Sebastian Lague (his source code can be found [here]( https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding/tree/master/Episode%2003%20-%20astar)).
